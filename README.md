## üåü How It Works

1. **Search:** Type your query; after a brief pause (debounce), the app fetches results from TMDB.
2. **Trending:** Each search updates Appwrite's database and increases the count for that search term.
3. **Movie Cards:** Display fetched movies with poster, rating, language, and release year.
4. **Trending Section:** Lists movies with the highest search count, pulled from Appwrite.
5. **Persistent State:** Appwrite cloud database ensures trending movies are tracked for all users.
